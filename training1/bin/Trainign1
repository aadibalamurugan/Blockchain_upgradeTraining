1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology which is not a language.
Blockchain can write in either jscript or python language.
Blockchain is not a bitcoin.
Blockchain are distubuted ledger + decentraized + cryptography  + immutable
Blockchain is " connecting of multiple nodes each other through the network (P2P),same time 
each node will have multiple blocks."
eachBlocks have some set of transaction which are managed by cryptography sha256.
Blockchain have 3 major area: public ,private ,consersium 


2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?

Third party - we can avoid third party like banks.
centraized - We can void centraized database.
security  - while doing transaction a to b, some one can hack the transaction.
Authentication - Valid the transaction.


3. What are the features that the blockchain will give you?
Immutable
Verifiable
Unchangeable transaction
Tamper Proof
Decentralized.


4. What are all the things the block contains?
2 PART : Header + Transaction
header : 4 area : 1. timestamp 2. nonce 3. prevous block hashcode 4.blocknumber
transaction : it wil have some set of  transaction,that txn link each other by cryptography 

5. How is the verifiability of blockchain can be achieved?
transaction will come into the blockchain network.
in network, all node will have the copy of that transaction in the mpool.
based on the nonce, the transaction will be added in the particular node based on the winning.
once that added , that will be send to other nodes to add that transaction .
so, suppose if u try to modify the transaction in future, then other nodes willnot allow to do that
because other nodes will have the same transaction with cryptography code.
